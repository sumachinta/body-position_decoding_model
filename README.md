# Neural decoding model
### A Python and MATLAB package for decoding neural activity and predicting body position
A regression model that can decode whisker position and locomotion speed from neuronal spike times.
There are both Python and MATLAB versions of this code. 

## Getting started
### Running in Python
Two files are required to run the decoder in Python
